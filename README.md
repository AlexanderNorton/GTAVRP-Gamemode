### GTA:V Roleplay Multiplayer Gamemode
This is a GTA:V multiplayer client gamemode that I helped create when I started programming. It used C#, Javascript and a MongoDB NoSQL database.
On release, we had almost 200 concurrent players and was one of the first major roleplaying gamemodes of its kind.
It's one of my proudest projects yet! Check out the trailer here:

### GTA:V multiplayer clients
There are a number of popular GTA:V multiplayer clients that allow developers to create custom gamemodes using assets from the base game. One example is FiveM.
Using the client's API, you can spawn all vehicles, characters and weapons. Menu systems from the base game can be used to create interactable menus for your gamemode. Basically anything from sounds to UI elements can all be modified using a programming language like C#. It can then be hosted on a server to allow players to join and play your gamemode.
Most interactions with the world are done using text based commands such as '/s [message]' for shouting, '/eat [item]' to eat something and so on. 

### Roleplay Gamemode
The gamemode allowed players to join, create a character and give them a backstory. Players then had to interact with the world and other players as if they were that character. Metagaming (using real-world info in the game world) or powergaming (roleplaying impossible actions) would result in player warnings or bans issued by server moderators. It's a virtual world where you play as the character you create. Obtain money by doing jobs, join the police force, buy weapons, vehicles and clothes for your character. There was tons of things to do within the GTA world.

### Features

- **Moderation tools** that server moderators could use to warn/ban players, receive help requests and tools that allowed them to create custom jobs, houses and businesses that would populate the game world.
- **Player manager** that handled player accounts, commands players use, character data such as how much money they have and much more.
- **Job system** that allowed players to '/joinjob' and become a mechanic who could fix broken cars, a fisherman who could catch and sell fish, a garbageman who would visit various locations to pick up trash, a lumberjack, hunter and many more.
- **Property system** where players could buy and own a property such as a house or a business. Businesses allowed players to earn an income by allowing other players to buy items they sell. There was also a 'supply' system where businesses would depend on supplies provided by other players who did the delivery job. Players could also store items in their houses such as weapons for safe-keeping.
- **Group manager** where players could create a group and invite other players to it. Groups would be known in-game as 'gangs' but could also be the police force who had their own unique commands (/tazer, /arrest, etc.).
- **Inventory system** that allowed players to store and retrieve weapons and other items from car trunks or houses.
- **Vehicle system** where players could buy vehicles at a dealership and /lock it to prevent it from being stolen. Vehicles would also run out of fuel and could be refilled at a gas station - among many other features.
- Tons more!


This was one of my first programming projects where I took a deep-dive into programming, game development and game design. It was extremely fun and I hope to get to work on many more exciting projects like this one in the future.
